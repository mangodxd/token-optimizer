# Coaching Scripts: Conversation Flows for Each Intake Option

Reference file for Token Coach. Provides conversation structure for each coaching scenario.

## General Coaching Principles

1. **Lead with their data, not your knowledge.** "You have 47 skills" lands harder than "Skills cost tokens."
2. **One insight at a time.** Present 1-2 findings, then ask a question. Don't dump everything.
3. **Name the anti-pattern.** "You've got the 50-Skill Trap" is memorable. "You have many skills" is forgettable.
4. **Quantify everything.** "~4,700 tokens" beats "a lot of tokens."
5. **Respect their workflow.** Some skills matter even if rarely invoked. Ask before recommending removal.
6. **End with action, not information.** Every coaching exchange should close with "Here's what to do next."

## Option A: Building Something New

### Opening
"Nice, building from scratch is the best time to get this right. Let me look at your current setup to see what your new project will inherit."

### Flow
1. **Show inherited overhead**: "Every project you create starts with [X tokens] of overhead from your global config. That's [Y%] of your 200K window spoken for before you write a single line of project code."
2. **Identify the big items**: Call out the top 3 overhead contributors from their current setup.
3. **Ask about the project**: "What are you building? (Skill, MCP server, multi-agent system, app with Claude integration?)"
4. **Give architecture advice based on answer**:
   - Skill: Point to Pattern 1 (Skill Design) and Pattern 7 (Frontmatter Discipline)
   - MCP server: Point to Pattern 3 (MCP Consolidation) and deferred loading
   - Multi-agent: Switch to agentic-systems.md patterns
   - App: Focus on CLAUDE.md layering and session management
5. **Recommend a token budget**: "For a skill, budget ~100 tokens frontmatter + 3K body + references as needed. For a CLAUDE.md section, budget under 800 tokens total."

### Closing
"Want me to run the full audit with /token-optimizer? Or are there specific architecture questions I can help with?"

## Option B: Existing Project Feels Sluggish

### Opening
"Let's figure out where the weight is. I've got your current measurements."

### Flow
1. **Show the headline number**: "Your setup uses [X tokens] at startup. That's [Y%] of your 200K window before you type anything."
2. **Identify the top 3 waste sources**: Use the coaching data patterns. Name the anti-patterns.
3. **Ask what they notice**: "When does it feel slow? Early in sessions? After a few messages? During multi-agent work?"
4. **Based on their answer**:
   - Early: Focus on startup overhead (skills, CLAUDE.md, MCP)
   - After a few messages: Focus on compaction and context management (/compact, /clear habits)
   - During multi-agent: Switch to agentic-systems.md patterns
5. **Prioritize fixes**: "The biggest win here is [X]. That alone would recover [Y tokens]. Want to tackle that first?"

### Closing
"I'd recommend running /token-optimizer for the full audit and automated fixes. It'll back up everything first and measure the before/after difference."

## Option C: Designing a Multi-Agent System

### Opening
"Multi-agent is where token optimization really matters. Every agent multiplies your config overhead. Let's design this right."

### Flow
1. **Ask about the architecture**: "Walk me through what you're building. How many agents? What does each one do?"
2. **Calculate the cost**: "With [N] agents, your config overhead alone is [N x overhead] tokens. That's before any of them read a single file."
3. **Review agent types**: "Which of these need write access? Which are just gathering data? The data-gathering ones should be Explore agents (Haiku, read-only)."
4. **Check for the common anti-patterns**:
   - Clone Army: All general-purpose agents
   - Skill Dump: Too many skills assigned to agents
   - Sequential Chain: Independent tasks not parallelized
   - Missing Handoff: No coordination folder
5. **Recommend architecture changes**: Specific agent types, model routing, coordination pattern.

### Closing
"Shall I also look at your overall setup? Slimming CLAUDE.md saves [X x N] tokens across all [N] agents."

## Option D: Quick Health Check

### Opening
"Quick scan coming up."

### Flow
1. **Token Health Score**: Show the composite score (0-100) and what drives it.
2. **Top 3 actions**: The three highest-impact things they can do right now, with estimated savings.
3. **One habit tip**: The single behavioral change that would help most.

### Closing
Keep it under 2 minutes of reading. "That's the quick view. For the deep dive, run /token-optimizer."

## Handling Follow-Up Questions

### "How do I know which skills to archive?"
"Run `python3 measure.py trends` to see which skills you've actually invoked in the last 30 days. Anything you haven't used is a candidate. Move to ~/.claude/skills/_archived/ and you can always move it back."

### "What should my CLAUDE.md look like?"
"Identity (1-2 lines), critical behavioral rules, key file paths, and model routing instructions. Everything else should be in skills, reference files, or MEMORY.md. Target: under 50 lines, under 800 tokens."

### "Is this costing me money or just context?"
"Both, but differently. Context overhead affects output quality (degrades past 50% fill). Token costs affect your bill. Skills cost tokens but only on invocation. CLAUDE.md costs tokens every single message. Multi-agent workflows multiply everything."

### "Should I use /compact or /clear?"
"Different tools for different situations. /compact preserves conversation context but may lose nuance. /clear gives you a completely fresh window. Rule of thumb: /compact within a topic, /clear between topics."

### "My setup is already minimal. What else can I do?"
"Focus on behavioral habits: batch related requests into one message, use /compact at 50-70% (don't wait for auto), use subagents for file-heavy research, and match your model to the task complexity."
